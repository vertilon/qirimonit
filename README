This means you can pipe it to any file or process if you like to

Requirements:
=============
* gcc, or any ASNI C99 suitable compiler
* libc
* make

How to build:
=============

$ make

Copy it to place  for binary files on your distribution.
Don't forget to add this directory to your $PATH env variable.
Run it with simple:
$ qirimonit

Configuration:
==============
To simply add more metrics or custom outputs, simply modify source code :)
